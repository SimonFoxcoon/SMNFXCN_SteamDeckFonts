# SMNFXCN_SteamDeckFonts

A pack of fonts for use with the CSS Loader plugin on the Decky plugin loader for Steam Deck.
I made this for personal use but then decided to share this.


# Installation

### Theme:

 1. Download the repo using Code -> Download ZIP
 2. Extract it, and place the `SMNFXCN_Fonts` folder into
    `/home/deck/homebrew/themes/`

### Fonts:
Since I am not distributing the fonts that are needed for this theme you will need to find these yourself.
Once you find these fonts, install them in Desktop Mode.

 - Select all the fonts then open the context menu (right click or left
   trackpad) -> Install -> Personal

If you install them system wide they will be wiped when you update SteamOS.
Keep in mind the names of the font must match the name in the .css files. 

# FAQ

 - **Q**: Will you use the manual plugin install function within the CSS Loader to make this process faster and easier?
   **A**: No, because you will need to obtain these fonts.

 - **Q**: Why aren't any of the fonts included?
   **A**: Due to copyright issues, I will not host them. Admittedly many of them are easy to find and you do not need all of them, just the
   ones you want to use.

 - **Q**: Will you add this font pack to the official Steam Themes DB?
   **A**: No. Not with or without the fonts.
   
 - **Q**: What is the purpose?
   **A**: To be able to swap between fonts while offline. That's really just it. If it's installed (properly) you will never not be able to
   access it.

 - **Q**: Do I need one font or all fonts in a family?
   **A**: You should install all fonts whenever possible. There are several fonts within this pack that do not contain other variations
   so keep that in mind.

 - **Q**: Do you take suggestions?
   **A**: Yes, in the issues tab. You can suggest a font by it's font family or the name of the individual font, a Google Fonts link also
   works if it's easy to access/download. The font should be legible and
   no dingbat fonts. It should look good within the Deck UI. If a font looks bad I may fix it, if I can.

 - **Q**: Can I edit this?
   **A**: Yes, as this is not entirely my original work. Big thanks to [EMERALD0874](https://github.com/EMERALD0874/Steam-Deck-Themes)'s
   original Steam Deck Fonts theme, which I used as a base for this
   pack. You should credit them. For me, I do not mind, but it is
   appreciated. You may use this in your other projects.

 - **Q**: Why is there a second Genshin font? 
   **A**: For the sake of convenience, there is a second option. It's the same font, but HYV changed the name of the font found within the
   files. It can be located within:
   `GenshinImpact_Data\StreamingAssets\MiHoYoSDKRes\HttpServerResources\font`
   You do not need both.
